# MarketingCampaignDashboard
*A company wants to have an overview of its marketing campaigns results for 3 consecutive years. Alongside, the dashboard shows interesting feautures about its products, purchase channels and customers.*
I've used several tools in this one:

**Data Exploration and Cleaning** using **python**

**Building a Dashboard** using **PowerBI**

**Some Extra Modifcations Before Finalizing** using **Excel Functions**

Dataset used is from Maven Analytics.
